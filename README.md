# DCGAN-GCN-DQN

This repository contains codes for a computer assignment for Neural Networks and Deep Learning course (CSC413/2516, Winter 2022, UofT)

In this assignment, we code and trained GANs, GCN (Graph Convolution Network) as well as DQN (Deep Q-learning Network).
The assignment is divided into three parts: in the first part, we implemented a specific
type of GAN designed to process images, called a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN). We trained
the DCGAN to generate emojis from samples of random noise. In the second part, we implemented the vanilla version of GCN and GAT. 
In the third part, we implemented and trained a DQN agent to learn how to play the CartPole balancing game.
The codes are in PyTorch.
